Machine Learning Projects: Sonar, Breast Cancer, and Diabetes Prediction
This repository contains three beginner-friendly machine learning projects implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks. These projects use various classification algorithms to solve real-world problems, such as predicting cancer types, diagnosing diabetes, and detecting sonar signals. Each notebook provides a hands-on learning experience with different machine learning models and data preprocessing techniques.
Projects Overview
1. Sonar Rock-Mine Prediction
Description: The goal of this project is to predict whether an object in sonar data is a rock or a mine based on its sonar signal.
Dataset: The dataset consists of sonar signals classified as either a rock or a mine.
Models Used: Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, etc.
Key Concepts: Data preprocessing, classification, feature engineering, model evaluation.

2. Breast Cancer Prediction
Description: This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on several diagnostic features.
Dataset: The dataset contains various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, such as the texture, smoothness, and area of the tumor.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees.
Key Concepts: Data exploration, classification, model selection, accuracy evaluation.

4. Diabetes Prediction
Description: The objective is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical information, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and insulin levels.
Dataset: A dataset containing various health metrics of patients, where the target variable is whether they have diabetes (Yes/No).
Models Used: Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forest.
Key Concepts: Supervised learning, data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets, model performance evaluation.
